Can you tell something about Azure Cloud Service?

Azure Cloud Service is a classic example of a platform as a service (PaaS). 
This was designed to support those applications which demand high scalability, 
reliability, and availability all within the constraints of reduced cost of operations.
These are hosted on virtual VMs and Azure provides more control over them by letting
 the developers install the necessary software and enabling them to control remotely.
Azure cloud services are used for deploying multi-tier web-based applications in Azure by means of creating an instance of cloud service. 
It is also possible to define multiple roles such as web roles, worker roles, etc for the purpose of distributed processing. 
Azure cloud services help in the easier and flexible scalability of the application.

What are the various models available for cloud deployment?

*Public Cloud: In this model, the cloud infrastructure is owned publicly by the cloud provider and 
there are chances that the server resources could be shared between multiple applications.

*Private Cloud: Here, the cloud infrastructure is owned exclusively by us or exclusive service is provided by the cloud provider to us.
This includes hosting our applications on our own on-premise servers or hosting
the application on a dedicated server provided by the cloud provider.

*Hybrid Cloud: As the name itself says, this model is the hybrid combination of private cloud and the public cloud.
This might include the scenario of using on-premise servers for processing confidential, 
sensitive data and using public cloud features for hosting public-facing applications.

What are the different DevOps solution architectures?

Multiple tools and technologies can be leveraged with Azure to design solution architectures for the below DevOps scenarios:

CI/CD for Azure VMs
CI/CD for Azure Web Apps
CI/CD for containers
DevTest image factory
Using Azure Web Apps and Jenkins for Java CI/CD 
Using Jenkins and Terraform on Azure Virtual Architecture for immutable infrastructure CI/CD 
Using Jenkins and Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service for Container CI/CD 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many cloud service roles are provided by Azure?

Cloud service roles comprise a set of application and configuration files. There are 2 kinds of roles provided by Azure:

*Web role: This provides a dedicated web server belonging to IIS (Internet Information Services)
that is used for automatic deployment and hosting of front-end websites.

*Worker role: These roles help the applications hosted within them to run asynchronously for longer durations
and are independent of the user interactions and generally do not use IIS. They are also ideal for performing background processes.
 The applications are run in a standalone manner.

6. Why is Azure Diagnostics API needed?

Azure Diagnostics API helps us collect diagnostic data such as performance monitoring, system event logs,
 etc from the applications that are running on Azure.
For the verbose monitoring of the data, Azure Diagnostics has to be enabled for the cloud service roles.
The diagnostics data can be used for building visual chart representations for better monitoring
 and also for creating performance metric alerts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Define Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)?

The Azure SLA is a contract that ensures or guarantees that when two or more role instances of a role are deployed on Azure, 
access to that cloud service is guaranteed for at least 99.95% of the time.
It also states that if the role instance process is not in the running state,
 then the detection of such processes and corrective action for the same will be taken 99.9% percent of the time.
If the mentioned guarantees are not satisfied at any point in time, then Azure credits a percentage 
of monthly fees to us depending on the pricing model of the respective Azure services

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Azure Test Plans?

Azure Test Plans is a service provided by Azure DevOps. 
It provides a browser-based test management solution along with crucial capabilities in user acceptance testing, 
exploratory testing, and planned manual testing. It also includes a browser extension for the provision of exploratory
testing as well as feedback from stakeholders.

Exploratory and manual testing are critical methods that consist of the evaluation of product or service quality.

Azure Test Plans, additionally, focus on DevOps on automated testing. It combines the contributions from 
developers, managers, testers, product owners, and user experience advocates and enhances the quality of a project

Define azure storage key.

Azure storage key is used for authentication for validating access for the azure storage service 
to control access of data based on the project requirements.
2 types of storage keys are given for the authentication purpose -
Primary Access Key
Secondary Access Key
The main purpose of the secondary access key is for avoiding downtime of the website or application.

Is it possible to login to a Linux Virtual Machine without using a password?

Yes, it is possible by making use of the Key Vault mapping to any Admin VM, 
we can log in to another VM without the need for a password

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are IaaS, PaaS and SaaS?

*IaaS: This stands for “Infrastructure as a Service” which provides a set of capabilities like OS, 
network connectivities, etc which are at the infrastructural level and are delivered as pay per use policy. 
The infrastructure is used for hosting applications. Examples include Azure VM, VNET, etc.

*PaaS: PaaS stands for “Platform as a Service” which is mostly about underlying infrastructure abstraction
 to the developers for enabling quicker development of the applications without the need for worry about hosting management.
 Examples include Azure web apps, Storage services, cloud services, etc.

*SaaS: SaaS stands for “Software as a Service” and are those applications which are delivered using
 the service delivery model where the applications are simply consumed and used by an organization. 
 These applications are generally mobilized by making the organization pay for their usage or through ads. 
 Examples include applications like Office 365, Gmail, SharePoint Online, and so on.
